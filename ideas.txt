*** Strategies ***

Altruistic strategy:
	Maximizes the total score for everyone

"Fair" strategy:
	If I have more score than the average, then I try to be altruistic, otherwise I'm selfish.

Greedy strategy:
	Always goes for the immediate Nash equilibrium! (Maximizes own score)

"Democratic" strategy:
	Some sort of maximizing the score of my audience

??? Neural networks ???
Taking the audience distribution as input and the output nodes of the network would determine the probability of connecting to someone in the specific audiences.
